# AlgorithmPractice

To prepare for a new job as scientific assistant in the subject "INF102 - Algorithms, Datastructures & Programming" at UiB, I spent some weeks working through the course curriculum during the summer.
This collection of algorithms and datastructures is somewhat of a hot mess and was purely created for practice. The repository should therefore be approached like a messy sketch book rather than than a structured, meaningful project. Show mercy!
