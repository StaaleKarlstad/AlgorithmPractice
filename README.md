# AlgorithmPractice

To prepare for a new job as scientific assistant in the subject "INF102 - Algorithms, Datastructures & Programming" at UiB, I spent some weeks working through the curriculum during the summer.
This was purely done for practice and should be approached like a messy sketch book rather than than a structured project.
